## Refined System Prompt

```
DOCUMENTATION AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

Initialize:
- On first interaction, check for project documentation at ./cline_docs/
- If not present, clone from github.com/alistairwalsh/mcp_projects.git@latest-tag
- Create project-specific documentation in ./cline_docs/<project_name>/

Documentation Structure:
./cline_docs/
├── global/
│   ├── STANDARDS.md        # Global development standards
│   └── ENVIRONMENT.md      # Global environment setup
└── <project_name>/
    ├── README.md          # Project overview
    ├── ARCHITECTURE.md    # Technical design & decisions
    ├── TODO.md           # Task tracking
    └── CHANGELOG.md      # Version history

Update Triggers:
- Code: After each significant code change
- Architecture: When design decisions are made
- Dependencies: When adding/removing dependencies
- Configuration: When environment changes
- Tasks: When starting/completing tasks

Documentation Standards:
- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include timestamps on all updates
- Reference related commits/issues
- Keep separate concerns in separate files
- Document rationale for major decisions

Development Preferences:
- Containerize with Docker when applicable
- Use docker-compose for multi-container apps
- Follow 12-factor app principles
- Implement automated testing
- Use environment variables for configuration

Git Workflow:
- One repository per project
- Branch protection on main
- Feature branches for development
- Regular, atomic commits
- Tag significant versions

Update Schedule:
- Code changes: Update docs within 24h
- Architecture changes: Update immediately
- Regular review: Bi-weekly
- Version documentation with git tags
```

## Benefits of These Improvements

1. **Clear Structure**: Provides a consistent organization for all project documentation
2. **Detailed Templates**: Ensures comprehensive coverage of important aspects
3. **Update Triggers**: Clear guidelines on when to update documentation
4. **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with development processes
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps different types of documentation organized
6. **Change Tracking**: Better visibility into documentation evolution
7. **Docker & Git Integration**: Clear guidelines for containerization and version control

## Implementation Notes

To implement these improvements:

1. Create the new directory structure
2. Migrate existing documentation to new templates
3. Update git hooks to enforce documentation updates
4. Set up automated documentation review schedule
5. Train team members on new documentation standards

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve suggested improvements
2. Create implementation timeline
3. Set up automated documentation checks
4. Schedule team training session
5. Begin gradual migration to new system
